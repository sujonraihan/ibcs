- Incremental Backup: 7 days

# Weekly Backups  
- Full Backup: 12 weeks

# Monthly Backups
- Full Backup: 12 months

# Yearly Backups
- Full Backup: 7 years
```

### 4.3 Retention Categories
**Short-term Retention:**
- Daily backups: 7-30 days
- Weekly backups: 1-3 months
- Monthly backups: 6-12 months

**Long-term Retention:**
- Yearly backups: 3-7 years
- Archive data: 10+ years
- Compliance data: As per regulatory requirements

### 4.4 Retention Implementation
**Step 1: Policy Creation**
```bash
1. CommCell Console > Policies
2. Create New Policy
3. Select Retention tab
4. Set retention rules
5. Save policy
```

**Step 2: Policy Association**
- Associate policy with client group
- Associate policy with specific client
- Associate policy with schedule
